## Introduction 
I studied Java for about 4 months, but I didn't see results, so I sat down and thought about what 
I could do to feel like a full-fledged Java developer. 
And then I came up with the idea to make this project, without tutorials, from scratch

## About the project 
Implementation of an online clothing store. Main functionalities:
1. Viewing products
2. Selection of goods to the basket
3. Removing goods from the basket
4. Registration in the system and receiving a message by mail (email integration)
5. Purchase of goods using PayPal
6. Checking whether the product is available

This is my first project, so the code here is terrible, but I'm learning and the main idea was to make a full project and deploy it
